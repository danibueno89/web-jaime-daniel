                        The Yale Center for Environmental Justice is in the process of planning our fourth annual Global
                        Environmental Justice Conference, with this year.

                        The Yale Arts Apprenticeship Program is an initiative that connects Yale undergraduates,
                        particularly those on financial aid, with professionals.

                        Hey everyone! I’ve been mapping public art in New Haven as part of my nonprofit project
                        ArtAround and I’d love to invite you to join me or just check it out.

                <p>I would like to note Mel Bochner’s passing on February 12, 2025. He was a valued colleague, a
                    brilliant interlocutor, never brought less than his A-game to studio visits and reviews, he had a
                    voice that brought insight to the conversation, and had an outstanding sense of humor. I was
                    fortunate to be his colleague. Students felt fortunate for the exchange they shared. He never
                    varnished his truth. May he rest in peace.

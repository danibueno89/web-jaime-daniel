                        ArtAround and I’d love to invite you to join me or just check it out.

                <h2>Mel<br>Bochner’s</h2>
                <p>I would like to note Mel Bochner’s passing on February 12, 2025. He was a valued colleague, a
                    brilliant interlocutor, never brought less than his A-game to studio visits and reviews, he had a
                    voice that brought insight to the conversation, and had an outstanding sense of humor. I was
                    fortunate to be his colleague. Students felt fortunate for the exchange they shared. He never
                    varnished his truth. May he rest in peace.

                <p>
                    The School of Art is one of Yale’s Graduate & Professional Schools conferring MFA degrees in Graphic
                    Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture; and offers undergraduate-level art courses
                    to Yale College students. Our website exists as an ongoing collaborative experiment in digital
                    publishing and information sharing. It functions as a wiki—all members of the School of Art
                    community have the ability to add new, and edit most existing content.
